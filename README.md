# cooperatives

www for cultural cooperatives, yeah!

## who
[Marisol Sandoval](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/marisol-sandoval), [AltGen](http://www.altgen.org.uk/), and [Blake House](http://blake.house/) are creating an online space to encourage collaboration and solidarity within the cultural co-operative movement.

## why
Freelance work is precarious but standard employment is competitive and often exploitative. Co-operation offers a way out.

## how
This site has a tiny, experimental, GitHub backed CMS. It uses prose.io to edit files in content/ which is requested directly from github. No server, no hosting fees, no testing, no databases, no authentication management: perfect for projects tight on time and money.
