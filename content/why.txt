Cultural co-ops transform work creatively, economically, and politically. Creatively, co-ops question the myth of an individual genius and instead emphasize the collaborative qualities of any creative process. Economically, co-ops empower their members to decide on how they work together and to reduce insecurity through mutual solidarity. Politically, co-operatives challenge the boundaries between economy and politics, establishing the workplace and the larger economy as a democratic space, and helping to shape the future of work for the better.
