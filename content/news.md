#### cultural.coop goes live!

Co-operatives are all about collaborating and working together, both within co-ops and beyond. But often it is hard to find the time or energy to start searching for other co-ops, reaching out to them and beginning to co-operate and support each other.

This website aims to help. The idea is to encourage collaboration, mutual support and solidarity among cultural co-ops. 

More than that, cultural.coop provides information about the co-operative model for anyone looking for alternatives to often individualised, precarious and exhausting working lives in the cultural sector.

Let's open up the conversation about the struggles faced by cultural workers and share our stories of resistance. Get in touch if you want to contribute to this blog or want to get involved in any other way.
