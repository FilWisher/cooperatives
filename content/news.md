#### Cultural Co-ops Feast – Don’t Be an Island!
[img](http://i.imgur.com/2dXUEAT.jpg)

It’s been an exciting spring for Cultural Co-ops. After launching our website and releasing two cultural co-ops videos, we gathered in London on May 20 to meet, discuss, play, think, plot, make plans and new friends. 

The day was a unique opportunity to begin a debate about what it means to be a co-operative in the cultural sector and the challenges that this entails. The morning session therefore focussed on the difficulties cultural co-ops are experiencing and in the afternoon we discussed how we can work together to address them. In between session we made plenty of time for informal discussions and co-operative games inspired by the Rochdale Co-operative Pioneers.

Co-ops suggest a way of working that is radically different from dominant capitalist work cultures; one that is based on economic democracy, equality, co-operation and solidarity. But being radical islands in a capitalist sea is neither easy nor is it enough. 

Participants agreed that co-ops need to carry their radical ideas into mainstream debates, collaborate and expand their reach. To strengthen co-ops it is important to take serious what it means to operate within capitalism. 

Capitalist economies function through buying and selling commodities and competing on markets with the goal of outperforming competitors to increase profit. This instrumental and competitive logic reduces culture to yet another sphere of commodity exchange and profit maximisation. One person’s success depends on someone else’s failure. 

Co-ops reject this logic but they can’t fully escape it. Refusing to play by the competitive rules of the capitalist game is risky and puts co-ops under pressure. Government funding at the moment does not offer much of an alternative. ‘Public’ funding schemes for art and culture have adopted a similarly competitive logic and often require match funding from private, corporate sources. 

But no matter how difficult the situation, co-ops continue to show that all of this is temporary and alternatives are possible. Knowing about the challenges and critiquing capitalism are first steps in finding solutions. Alternatives are not just possible but necessary – but we can only build them together.

Radical imagination is needed in order to envision pathways towards more just, democratic and egalitarian futures for everyone. Throughout the day we discussed how solidarity and mutual support can strengthen cultural co-ops and how we can collaborate with related groups, formulate political demands and build alliances with other movements in order to strengthen and expand the co-operative idea. The more hands, brains and harts are involved, the stronger we get – so if this project excites you, get in touch and be part of it!

#### cultural.coop goes live!

Co-operatives are all about collaborating and working together, both within co-ops and beyond. But often it is hard to find the time or energy to start searching for other co-ops, reaching out to them and beginning to co-operate and support each other.

This website aims to help. The idea is to encourage collaboration, mutual support and solidarity among cultural co-ops. 

More than that, cultural.coop provides information about the co-operative model for anyone looking for alternatives to often individualised, precarious and exhausting working lives in the cultural sector.

Let's open up the conversation about the struggles faced by cultural workers and share our stories of resistance. Get in touch if you want to contribute to this blog or want to get involved in any other way.
