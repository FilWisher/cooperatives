#### Why Altgen supports cultural.coop

Working in the cultural industries can damage your health. Young creatives in London will recognise this. Anxiety is rife. And no wonder: competition, image, status, long hours, rubbish pay, abuse from clients, disappointments, boredom – this is the norm for many would-be designers, photographers, artists, etc.

This has got to stop. We are letting this way of working kill our youth and creativity. We need to take care of each other, and win big against all those that keep us scraping the bottom of the barrel – landlords, bankers, managers and the Conservative government.

But first we've got to learn to take care of each other. Note – this is not only about “taking care of yourself”. Let's not get blinded to each other’s needs by a cloud of “mindfullness” – our problems are collective, and they require collective solutions. We need to build a culture of care and mutual support amongst young people. This means first recognising that there is something wrong about the way we work. This means not competing with each other for favour. This means covering for each other when someone is ill or down. It means asking for fair day rates and pay rises together. It means not getting into a race to the bottom when bidding for the same commission but working with each other, sharing skills and workloads, and empowering ourselves in the face of bullying clients. It means forming co-operatives and working together on supportive, equal terms. It means having each other's back. Together we are stronger!

But this won't be enough by itself. We also need to claim the rights we are losing and build a better future. This means freelancers, co-operatives, and young people of all stripes getting together to change our current governments and laws: keeping our NHS public, making higher education free for all, raising the minimum wage, campaigning for a universal basic income, calling for a shorter working week and supportive social security. We have a right to a good life, but we'll have to come together to get it.

Cultural.coop is a step in the right direction. For Altgen, it is about bringing together those who have chosen an alternative economic model and fostering this alternative culture of mutual support amongst young people as a new radical mainstream for people working in the cultural industries. Only by building such a culture can we come together and win.

#### Cultural Co-ops Feast – Don’t Be an Island!

It’s been an exciting spring for Cultural Co-ops. After launching our website and releasing two cultural co-ops videos, we gathered in London on May 20 to meet, discuss, play, think, plot, make plans and new friends.

The day was a unique opportunity to begin a debate about what it means to be a co-operative in the cultural sector and the challenges that this entails. The morning session therefore focussed on the difficulties cultural co-ops are experiencing and in the afternoon we discussed how we can work together to address them. In between session we made plenty of time for informal discussions and co-operative games inspired by the Rochdale Co-operative Pioneers.

Co-ops suggest a way of working that is radically different from dominant capitalist work cultures; one that is based on economic democracy, equality, co-operation and solidarity. But being radical islands in a capitalist sea is neither easy nor is it enough.

Participants agreed that co-ops need to carry their radical ideas into mainstream debates, collaborate and expand their reach. To strengthen co-ops it is important to take serious what it means to operate within capitalism. 

Capitalist economies function through buying and selling commodities and competing on markets with the goal of outperforming competitors to increase profit. This instrumental and competitive logic reduces culture to yet another sphere of commodity exchange and profit maximisation. One person’s success depends on someone else’s failure. 

Co-ops reject this logic but they can’t fully escape it. Refusing to play by the competitive rules of the capitalist game is risky and puts co-ops under pressure. Government funding at the moment does not offer much of an alternative. ‘Public’ funding schemes for art and culture have adopted a similarly competitive logic and often require match funding from private, corporate sources. 

But no matter how difficult the situation, co-ops continue to show that all of this is temporary and alternatives are possible. Knowing about the challenges and critiquing capitalism are first steps in finding solutions. Alternatives are not just possible but necessary – but we can only build them together.

Radical imagination is needed in order to envision pathways towards more just, democratic and egalitarian futures for everyone. Throughout the day we discussed how solidarity and mutual support can strengthen cultural co-ops and how we can collaborate with related groups, formulate political demands and build alliances with other movements in order to strengthen and expand the co-operative idea. The more hands, brains and harts are involved, the stronger we get – so if this project excites you, get in touch and be part of it!

#### cultural.coop goes live!

Co-operatives are all about collaborating and working together, both within co-ops and beyond. But often it is hard to find the time or energy to start searching for other co-ops, reaching out to them and beginning to co-operate and support each other.

This website aims to help. The idea is to encourage collaboration, mutual support and solidarity among cultural co-ops. 

More than that, cultural.coop provides information about the co-operative model for anyone looking for alternatives to often individualised, precarious and exhausting working lives in the cultural sector.

Let's open up the conversation about the struggles faced by cultural workers and share our stories of resistance. Get in touch if you want to contribute to this blog or want to get involved in any other way.
