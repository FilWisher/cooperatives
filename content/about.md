This website aims to support the formation of a political movement of cultural co- ops. Its purpose is to encourage collaboration, mutual support and solidarity within the sector by building a directory of cultural co-ops in the UK, as well as publishing research, stories and information about cultural co-operatives.

This project is the result of a collaboration between [Marisol Sandoval](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/marisol-sandoval), lecturer at City University London who researches the politics of cultural co-ops, and the co-operatives [Altgen](http://www.altgen.org.uk/) and [Blake House](http://blake.house/). Get in touch if you want to get involved in building a movement for a co-operative future. Let us know if you: (a) know of a cultural co-op that should be included in our directory, (b) want to connect to other cultural co-ops or share events, resources, research, reflections and stories from the world of cultural co-ops, or (c) have anything else to say!
