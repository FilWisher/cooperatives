Welcome to cultural.coop! 

Co-operatives are all about collaborating and working together, both within co-ops and beyond. But often it is hard to find the time or energy to start searching for other co-ops, reaching out to them and beginning to co-operate and support each other.

This website aims to help. The idea is to encourage collaboration, mutual support and solidarity among cultural co-ops. 

More than that, cultural.coop provides information about the co-operative model for anyone looking for alternatives to often individualised, precarious and exhausting working lives in the cultural sector. 

So, if you want to find out more about cultural co-ops and how they work, click on the [STORIES](http://cultural.coop/stories) section of the website, where you will find short videos introducing some co-ops working in the cultural sector. 

Still not sure why the co-operative model is a good idea?  You might find some answers under [WHY](http://cultural.coop/why) and [RESOURCES](http://cultural.coop/resources). 

If you want to find out about cultural co-ops working in your area or in a particular part of the cultural sector, go to our [DIRECTORY](http://cultural.coop/directory). It is still growing, so if you know of any co-op that should be included, please let us know. 

[Email](http://cultural.coop/contact) us if you want to contribute, let us know what you think or just say hi.

This project is the result of a collaboration between [Marisol Sandoval](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/marisol-sandoval), lecturer at City University London who researches the politics of cultural co-ops, and the co-operatives [Altgen](http://www.altgen.org.uk/) and [Blake House](http://blake.house/). Get in touch if you want to get involved in building a movement for a co-operative future. Let us know if you: (a) know of a cultural co-op that should be included in our directory, (b) want to connect to other cultural co-ops or share events, resources, research, reflections and stories from the world of cultural co-ops, or (c) have anything else to say!
